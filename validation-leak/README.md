# validation-leak

`Validation` and its applicative instance are defined something like this:

```haskell
data Validation e a
  = Failure e
  | Success a

instance Semigroup e => Applicative (Validation e) where
  pure = Success

  Failure e1 <*> Failure e2 = Failure (e1 <> e2)
  Failure e  <*> Success _  = Failure  e
  Success _  <*> Failure e  = Failure  e
  Success f  <*> Success x  = Success (f x)
```

Look at these two lines:

```haskell
  Failure e1 <*> Failure e2 = Failure (e1 <> e2)
  Failure e  <*> Success _  = Failure  e
```

If the first argument to `(<*>)` is a `Failure`, then we have a `Failure` regardless of what the second argument is.
But nevertheless the second argument is forced before a final `Failure` is returned. This means that before
any actual errors are returned, a whole computation must finish -- no lazy streaming of errors is possible.
Which also implies that `Validation` can never be short-circuiting: even if you don't care about actual errors
and just want to know whether a computation has finished successfully, you won't be able to stop early once an error has occured.
In the same way if you only care about some particular error and have encountered it, it won't be possible to stop here --
all errors must be collected before the result of a `Validation e a` computation can be handled in any way.

Here is a simple fix:

```haskell
instance Monoid e => Applicative (Validation e) where
  pure = Success

  Failure e1 <*> b = Failure $ e1 `mappend` case b of
    Failure e2 -> e2
    Success _  -> mempty
  Success _  <*> Failure e  = Failure  e
  Success f  <*> Success x  = Success (f x)
```

If the first argument to `(<*>)` is a `Failure e1`, then return a `Failure` and prepend `e1` to the result which can be either `mempty`
(if there are no more errors) or some `e2`. Note that this requires `e` to be a `Monoid` while previously it only had to be a `Semigroup`,
so this instance is not strictly better than the leaking one.

Similar considerations apply to `Control.Applicative.Lift`:

```haskell
instance Applicative f => Applicative (Lift f) where
  pure = Pure

  Pure  f <*> Pure x  = Pure  (f x)
  Pure  f <*> Other y = Other (f <$> y)
  Other f <*> Pure x  = Other (($ x) <$> f)
  Other f <*> Other y = Other (f <*> y)
```

Though, `($ x) <$> f` is better than `f <*> pure x`, so it's not immediately clear whether the `Applicative` instance for `Lift` should be changed.

UPDATE: reddit user **xalyama** [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7hy4ml/validation_leaks/dqunqnf/) the following version

```haskell
instance Semigroup e => Applicative (Validation e) where
  pure = Success

  Failure e1 <*> b = Failure $ case b of
    Failure e2 -> e1 <> e2
    Success _  -> e1
  Success _  <*> Failure e  = Failure  e
  Success f  <*> Success x  = Success (f x)
```

which [doesn't stream only the last occured failure](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7hy4ml/validation_leaks/dquoiow/),
but streams all previous ones and also doesn't require `e` to be a `Monoid`. Hence this version is strictly better than what is commonly used at the time of writing.

## Testing

A simple test

```haskell
multifail :: (Except f [Int], Applicative f) => f ()
multifail = go 1000000 where
  go 0 = pure ()
  go n = throw [n] *> go (n - 1)
```

reveals that `Leak.Validation` indeed leaks:

and `Fine.Validation` indeed doesn't leak:
